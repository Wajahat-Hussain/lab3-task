            <p id="text">To travel from one place to another in different purposes is generally called travelling. People do not travel
                always in the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure,
                someone travels for business purposes etc. It has much educative value. It is a part of education. Our education
                and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. We can learn many things by travelling. It teaches
                us trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. Therefore, the
                educative value of travelling beggars description. </p>
